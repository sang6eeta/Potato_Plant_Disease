# Potato Plant Disease Classification using CNN

This project is focused on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of potato plants into three categories: healthy, early blight, and late blight.
The model is implemented using PyTorch.

## Project Structure

- `model.py`: Contains the implementation of the Improved CNN model.
- `train.py`: Script to train the model.
- `data_loader.py`: Script to load and preprocess the dataset.

### Prerequisites
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy

### Datasets Used
The dataset used for training and testing the model is available on Kaggle. You can download it from the following link:
